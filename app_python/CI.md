## Folder-Specific Triggers
- Configured workflows to run only when changes occur in their respective folders.
- Reduces unnecessary workflow executions and enhances efficiency.

## Additional Language CI
- Applied the same steps as the Python CI workflow to set up CI for an extra language application.
