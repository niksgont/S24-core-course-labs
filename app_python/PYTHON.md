# Python Web Application

## Framework Choice
I chose **Flask** because it is a lightweight and beginner-friendly web framework suitable for small applications.

## Best Practices
- Modular code structure: Routes are defined clearly in `app.py`.
- Code readability: Followed PEP 8 standards.
- Dependency management: Used `requirements.txt` for tracking dependencies.
- Testing: Verified the application updates the time correctly.

## Testing and Code Quality
- Manual testing in the browser confirmed the correct Moscow time display.
- Debugging enabled during development to catch errors early.
